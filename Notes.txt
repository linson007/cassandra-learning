keypoints
		Distributed DB
		highly scalable
		manage very large amounts of structured data
		high availability with no single point of failure
		type of NoSQL
		It is scalable, fault-tolerant ( is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of (or one or more faults within) some of its components)
			and consistent(acting or done in the same way over time, especially so as to be fair or accurate.)
		It is a column-oriented database
		
Features of Cassandra
		Elastic scalability -  highly scalable; it allows to add more hardware to accommodate more customers and more data
		Always on architecture - no single point of failure, used in cases which cannot afford a failure
		Fast linear-scale performance - linearly scalable, i.e., it increases your throughput as you increase the number of nodes in the cluster. Therefore it maintains a quick response time.
		Flexible data storage - accommodates all possible data formats including: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. It can dynamically accommodate changes to your data structures according to your need.
		Easy data distribution -  provides the flexibility to distribute data where you need by replicating data across multiple data centers
		Transaction support âˆ’ Cassandra supports  ACID properties like Atomicity ( entire transaction take place at once or doesnt happen at all) , Consistency (Database must consistent before and after the transaction), Isolation(Multiple transaction can occur at the same time without interfer each other), and Durability ( changes of successful transaction occurs even the system fails ) (ACID).
